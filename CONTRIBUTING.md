# Contributing to Magic Curves

Thank you for considering contributing to Magic Curves! We welcome contributions in various forms, including bug fixes, feature implementations, and improvements to documentation.

## Guidelines for Contributions

- **Tests**: Every new feature or bug fix must be accompanied by appropriate tests. Please ensure that your tests cover a range of cases and are included in the corresponding module's test section.

- **Mathematical Proof**: When contributing new bonding curves or modifying existing ones, please include a mathematical proof or a detailed explanation of the algorithm used. This ensures that the implementation is correct and can be understood by others.

- **Integer Arithmetic**: Prefer using integer arithmetic over floating-point arithmetic whenever possible. This helps to avoid precision issues, especially in financial and scientific calculations.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes, ensuring that all tests pass.
4. Open a pull request with a clear description of your changes and any relevant mathematical proofs or explanations.

## Code Style

Please follow the Rust community's standard practices for coding style and documentation. If you're unsure about any aspect, feel free to ask for clarification in your pull request.

We appreciate your contributions and efforts to improve Magic Curves!

Thank you,
